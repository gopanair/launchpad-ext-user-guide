title: Watching a deploy
description: The console, the phases, and the three lifetimes of a build log.
---

While a deploy is in flight, a console appears at the top of the app's page —
above the tabs, where you already are. One line saying what is happening, a bar
showing which phase it is in, and the build's own output underneath.

You do not have to go anywhere to watch a deploy. If you navigate away and come
back while it is still running, the console is still there.

## The three phases

Every deploy is **upload → scan → deploy**, in that order, and every step
belongs to exactly one of them.

| Phase | What is happening |
|---|---|
| **Upload** | Getting the code — a clone, or unpacking what you sent. Dependency directories are stripped here. |
| **Scan** | Resolving what your app installs and comparing it to your install's [dependency policy](../../run/dependencies/). |
| **Deploy** | Installing dependencies, running the build, starting the workload. |

Progress is a stream of snapshots. It is there so you can see movement; it is
never the thing that decides whether your deploy worked. The deployment's own
record is.

## The build log

The output of the build, live. Three things about it are worth knowing, because
they explain everything odd you might see:

- **A pane that joined mid-build says so.** If you opened the page after the
  build started, you get the lines from the moment you arrived and a note that
  earlier output is not in this pane. It is not lost — it is stored.
- **The stored log is offered, never substituted.** When a build finishes, the
  complete log is available to read. Launchpad will not quietly swap the stored
  copy in underneath a live pane and leave you unsure which you were reading.
- **One stream per build, per page.** Opening the same build in two tabs does
  not double anything up.

## Afterwards

The **Logs** tab holds both of an app's logs behind one switch:

- **Build** — the log of one deploy. It has its own address, so you can link
  somebody straight to it.
- **App** — what the running process is printing.

While a deploy is in flight, or when the last one failed, the tab opens on
**Build**. That is where the answer is.

## Rejoining from the terminal

```bash
lp deploy --watch <deployID>
lp logs --deploy <deployID>
```

The first rejoins a build already running. The second prints a finished build's
log.

## What a deploy does not disturb

**The release that is serving keeps serving until a new one replaces it.** A
build that fails, times out or is refused changes nothing about what your users
are getting. There is no window where a failed deploy leaves you with nothing.
