/**
 * The Launchpad user guide.
 *
 * Built to a folder of HTML and committed as `dist/`, because that folder *is*
 * the deliverable: Launchpad never runs `npm install` or `astro build` for an
 * app, and `launchpad.toml`'s `[static] root = "dist"` is what tells the
 * detector to serve this repo rather than refuse it for having a package.json.
 *
 * `base` is not optional. A static app is served under `/apps/{slug}/`, and a
 * root-absolute URL without that prefix asks the *platform* for the file and
 * gets a 404. The slug is reserved (`_` belongs to apps Launchpad installs
 * itself), so it cannot be taken by an ordinary app and this value cannot go
 * stale behind a rename.
